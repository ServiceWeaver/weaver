      # The setup-go action's default caching behavior does not work well with
      # matrix tests. By default, setup-go caches the contents of `go env
      # GOCACHE` and `go env GOMODCACHE` under a key derived from the OS, the
      # go version, and a hash of the contents of go.sum [1].
      #
      # When we run a matrix test, every job uses the same cache key. As a
      # result, the jobs race, and the first to finish determines the contents
      # of the cache. Because caches are write-once, all other jobs fail to
      # update the cache. In subsequent runs, all jobs use the contents of the
      # cache, even if the cache was generated by a different job.
      #
      # For example, if the "lint" job finishes first, then all future jobs
      # like "build" and "test" will use the cache produced by the "lint" job.
      # However, this cache is likely missing a lot of cached package and build
      # outputs, causing to the "build" and "test" jobs to redundantly download
      # and build dependencies again and again.
      #
      # To avoid this problem, we manually cache the contents of `go env
      # GOCACHE` and `go env GOMODCACHE` using a key derived from the OS, the
      # go version, the contents of go.sum, and the matrix command. See [2] for
      # more documentation on custom cache keys and paths.
