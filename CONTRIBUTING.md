## Contribution process

Here is a detailed outline of the steps needed to make changes to Service
Weaver.

1. Clone the repository.

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ServiceWeaver/weaver.git
   cd weaver
   ```

   If you have already cloned the repository for previous changes,
   you can reuse it, but make sure to first pull any recent changes
   to Service Weaver:

   ```shell
   cd weaver
   git switch main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Make a local branch in your clone.

   ```shell
   git switch -c my_branch  # Pick a name appropriate to your work
   ```

3. Make changes and commit to local branch.

   ```shell
   # ... editing, testing, ... 
   git commit ...
   ```

   If you need to make multiple commits (e.g., if you checkpoint as
   you work), consider using `git commit --amend` or some other git
   command to keep all of your changes in a single commit.
    
   TODO: should we avoid discouraging multi-commit PRs?

4. Pull any changes that may have been made in the shared repository
   main branch.

   ```shell
   git switch my_branch
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

   Note that this command may result in merge conflicts. Fix those if
   needed.

5. Push your branch to the corresponding branch in the shared repository.

   ```shell
   git switch my_branch
   git push -u origin my_branch
   ```

6. Select the branch you are working on in the drop-down menu of branches on
   https://github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver . Then hit the `Compare and pull
   request` button.

7. Respond to feedback, which may involve making new commits or
   updating your prior commits. If you made any changes, push them
   to github again. If you amended a commit, you will have to force
   the push.

   ```shell
   git switch my_branch
   git push --force
   ```

8. Once reviewers are happy, pull any main branch changes that may
   have happened since step 4.
   
   ```shell
   git switch my_branch
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

   If you made multiple commits, squash them together if you wish
   (typically using an interactive rebase).

   If you picked up new changes or made any changes, push your branch
   again to github, as described in step 7.

9. Ask somebody who has permissions (or do it yourself if you
   have permissions) to merge your branch into the main branch
   of the shared repository. The reviewer may do this without
   being asked.

   Select the `Rebase and merge` option on https://github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver
   or use the command line instructions found on that page.
