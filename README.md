<div class="announcement">
  <p style="color: inherit">Service Weaver began as an exploratory initiative to
    understand the challenges of developing, deploying, and maintaining distributed
    applications. We were excited by the strong interest from the developer community,
    which led us to open-source the project. 
  </p>
  <p style="color: inherit">We greatly appreciate the continued advocacy and support
    of the Service Weaver community. However, we realized that it was hard for users
    to adopt Service Weaver directly since it required rewriting large parts of
    existing applications. Therefore Service Weaver did not see much direct use
    and therefore <b>effective December 5, 2024, we will transition Service Weaver
    into maintenance mode</b>. After this date, for the next 6 months, we will only
    push critical commits to the GitHub repository, respond to critical issues,
    merge critical pull requests, and patch new releases. We recommend that users
    fork the repository and report any issues preventing them from maintaining a
    stable version of the code.
  </p>
  <p style="color: inherit"><b>On June 6, 2025, we plan to permanently freeze and
    archive the GitHub repository</b>, after which no new commits or releases will be made.

Service Weaver is a programming framework for writing, deploying, and managing
distributed applications. You can run, test, and debug a Service Weaver
application locally on your machine, and then deploy it to the
cloud with a single command.

```bash
$ go run .                      # Run locally.
$ weaver gke deploy weaver.toml # Run in the cloud.
```
