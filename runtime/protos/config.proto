  // Groups of components that must be co-located in the same OS process.
  //
  // This grouping allows the developer a level of control on where the Service
  // Weaver runtime will place each component. For example, suppose that the
  // application binary contains six components: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
  // Furthermore, suppose that the developer specifies the following grouping in
  // the config.
  //
  //  colocate = [[A, B], [C, D, E]]
  //
  // In that case, no matter what algorithm the Service Weaver runtime uses to
  // place the components, components A and B will always be grouped together,
  // and components C, D, and E will always be grouped together. This means that
  // a pair of replicas of the components can share in-memory state and
  // communicate efficiently with each other (though not with other replicas).
  //
  // The placement algorithm the Service Weaver runtime uses varies across
  // deployment environment. For example, a multiprocess deployer may choose to
  // place each component into its own group, for maximum parallelism. A
  // singleprocess deployer, on the other hand, may choose to group all of the
  // components together. Regardless of which deployment environment is used,
  // however, this configuration option guarantees that specified components
  // will end up in the same group.
  //
  // Components are identified using their full package paths, e.g.:
  //
  //   "github.com/my/project/package/ComponentName"
  //
  // with the exception of the component associated with the application main(),
  // which is identified using the name "main".
